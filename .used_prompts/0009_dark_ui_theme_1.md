Let's add dark theme to the UI. Mantine library has a great support for it. Make sure that nothing is missed and our custom styling supports this as well.
The switch between light/dark must be placed right before the profile/account dropdown.
---
We need to tweak cards background color. It is still white after the switch
---
Let's tweak the colors on the dark version. I want them to be less black and something closer to the gray
---
Let's add "Back to the landing" button to the dashboard page similarly to the existing back to dashboard buttons
---
Let's change back to landing button on the dasboard with a simple icon which upon a click will redirect us to root page. The icon will be the same as our favicon.svg
---
Let's fix visual issue in a different part of the application. The fake profile avatar icon is trimmed at the top and bottom a bit cause the circle is bigger then the heght of user profile dropdown button
---
Let's remove any custom fonts and make sure that all the texts are of the same font type.
Make sure all the headers in the widgets and cards are of the same size and all the page headers of the same size as well.
Regular text must be of the same size as well.
Leave the landing page intact.
