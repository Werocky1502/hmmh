# Calories management
Take a look at the current /weights page and weight parts of the /dashboard

## Calories management API
Let's create a copy of the weight api but modify it to represent calories instead.

## Calories management UI
Let's copy the /weights page to represent new /calories page on UI.
The dashboard calories must match what is build for weight.

## Weight and Calories differences
During the copy consider that you can create as many calories records per day as you want.
Ask me additional questions to build better calories chunk.

## Documentation update
Write an update to the root README file as well as hhmh.instructions.md in order to reflect the latest changes and planned phases. We must retain the previous completed plans as well.
