# API tests
Let's add API tests

## Testing project
Add a separate project right next to the main api project. It must be placed in the same folder.
Join two project via solution file.
Use default MS testing framework to avoid testing library integration.
Create tests per each code folder in API.

## Test run
Add a separate nx/npm command to run the API tests

## Documentation update
Write an update to the root README file as well as hhmh.instructions.md in order to reflect the latest changes and planned phases. We must retain the previous completed plans as well.
