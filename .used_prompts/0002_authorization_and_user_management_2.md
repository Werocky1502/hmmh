Let's change a bit of UI aspects. I want the root ui page to look prettier.
I don't want the patterned background. Let's change it to some beautiful gradient. Also let's change the font of the text on the root page cause it's too generic currently. Also the correct application name on the page must contain the correct spacing and case: "Help me manage my health". Place the button with some top margin.

Let's proceed with UI changes on login page. I want it to be more spacious. It's too narrow currently.
---
It seems there is no VITE_API_BASE_URL variable defined

I have a cors error durnig UI request:

Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5247/api/auth/sign-up' from origin 'http://localhost:4200' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

Now let's work with UI on the dashboard page. Let's change the font of app name in the header to be the same as heading font on root page. Also let's add some bottom border or shadow to the page header
