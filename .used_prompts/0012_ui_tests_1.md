# UI tests
Let's add UI tests

## Testing project
Add a separate test file per each component file and typescript logic files. Tests must be placed in the same folder as the original component under test.
Use some popular and well known testing framework for react + typescript app.

## Test run
Add a separate nx/npm command to run the UI tests

## Documentation update
Write an update to the root README file as well as hhmh.instructions.md in order to reflect the latest changes and planned phases. We must retain the previous completed plans as well.
